# cruise-ships :passenger_ship:

A Project for the Command Shift Software Engineering Bootcamp OOP module, using vanilla javascript.

The program contains 3 modules (Port, Itinerary and Ship), which pass information to each other through a Controller, 
making it possible to build itineraries, set sail and dock at subsequent ports. I've added a couple of my own additions, 
like keeping track of passengers coming aboard and disembarking.  


Visit the [next iteration](https://github.com/HollyJM81/cruise-ships-gui) to see this with a GUI, which renders the ports and ships in the browser :eyes:
